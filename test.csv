37,cfarrell,10.0,"THE classic game of the 90's. Belongs in every game collection. I still play this fairly often - just the basic game alone has surely cracked 100 plays, and throw in all the variants and expansions and this is an incredible system. --- Version Notes: Overall, I think the 2005-ish re-issue of Die Siedler von Catan from Kosmos - featuering plastic pieces - is the most attractive, funcational version of the game. It has bright, pleasing graphics, the smaller resource cards are easy to manage, and the plastic inserts are the most functional inserts ever for a game. It is in German, though. But every version has its charms, even going back to the borderline-ugly Mayfair 1st and 2nd printings (the ones that used photos - I don't actually own either of those printings, but I'd like to just to add to my collection). The 2007 Mayfair edition (the bigger box) is probably the nicest version that Mayfair has done, and is comparable and even superior in some ways to the 2005 Kosmos edition, the first time Mayfair has gone their own way  and done something at least as good as Kosmos. It also has the advantage of being in English. I generally like Mayfair's 3rd printing better than most players - I think it's a nice, distinct set with its own flavor apart from the other versions - but I'd also agree that it's overall not as graphically effective as the other versions, being a little dark.",13,Catan

41,andy hart,10.0,"So, it's a ten then. I hate to have to go with the crowd, but after several years playing, it's still one of the first games to come out during a session. Yes, there's a certain ammount of luck (I once won a game becuase the dice simply WOULD NOT stop coming up 4's. Guess who had 4) but it's usually up to the individual players as to what use they make out of their resources. An real winner. ",13,Catan

48,nadle,10.0,The best game invented in the last decade. With the changeable tileset and the trading system you don't get hardly boring. Also the subject reponds of one's desire: everyone wants to seek their fortune in the unexplored world. We've played once with ten players with two games and a 5&6 player expansion. Great fun.,13,Catan
